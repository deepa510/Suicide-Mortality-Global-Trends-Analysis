# 1.	Introduction:
This report presents an in-depth examination of global suicide mortality trends. It delves into suicide rates on a country level, tracking their evolution over time and examining potential correlations with GDP per capita and literacy rates. It is an overall objective to establish the patterns, identify crucial trends which can serve as basis of developing targeted intervention and policy for addressing this critical issue.
Problem Statement:
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
1.	What are the global suicide mortality rates, and how do they vary across countries?
2.	How have suicide mortality rates changed over the years?
3.	Which countries have the highest and lowest suicide mortality rates?
4.	Is there a correlation between suicide mortality rates and GDP per capita?
5.	Is there a correlation between suicide mortality rates and literacy rates?

# 2.	Methodology:
To ensure that our analyses are accurate, the data have undergone a meticulous processing and cleaning process. The examination also included the development of visual representations, such as maps, to illustrate the distribution of suicide mortality rates. In addition, this study examined trends over several years that identified countries with high or low ranked status as well as possible connections to GDP per capita and literacy rates.
Data Cleaning and Processing Steps:
Mentioned below are the key steps in the process of data cleansing and processing:
•	To ensure consistency, the country names and data formats have been ensured to be uniform. 
•	With a view to ensuring accuracy of spatial representation, the precision of geographical coordinates has been verified. 
•	To preserve the integrity of this dataset, it is necessary to find and amend any errors or inconsistencies in data.
